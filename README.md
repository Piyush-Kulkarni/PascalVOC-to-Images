# PascalVOC-to-Images

A small tool to create datasets from Pascal VOC images.
I've used it to cut images with bounding boxes generated by LabelImg.

## How to use

 1. Put your .xml and image files on data/ folder 
 2. Run python main.py OR main_classification.ipynb 

## Requirements

* Run pip install -r requirements.txt
